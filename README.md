# MyPortfolio

This repository contains my **personal technical portfolio**, showcasing selected projects I’ve built across **analytics, automation, and product-focused engineering**.

The projects here are **real-world, production-oriented solutions**, designed to reduce manual work, improve operational reliability, and support governance and decision-making in complex environments.

- **Jira Cloud Automation**
  - ScriptRunner (Groovy) tooling
  - Bulk issue creation and validation
  - Governance and audit utilities
  - Migration and post-migration support

- **Analytics & Data Workflows**
  - Structured data extraction and reporting
  - Repeatable, auditable processes
  - Decision-support tooling

## 🎯 Design principles

Across all projects, I prioritize:

- **Automation over manual processes**
- **Clarity over complexity**
- **Traceability and auditability**
- **Rerunnable, safe tooling**
- **Solutions that work in real operational environments**

---

## 📂 Repository structure

Each project typically includes:
- A concise overview (problem & solution)
- Supporting artifacts (scripts, exports, logs)
- Documentation explaining purpose and usage

Some code may be **sanitized or partial** when required, focusing on patterns and logic rather than proprietary details.
